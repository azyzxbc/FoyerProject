# üöÄ DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Project

This project showcases a complete CI/CD pipeline setup for automating the delivery of a **Spring Boot application**, focusing on best practices for code quality, containerization, monitoring, and deployment.

---

## üìñ Project Overview

Through this project, I explored the DevOps lifecycle and emphasized automation in modern software development. Below are the key technologies and tools utilized:

### üîπ Key Features
1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Configured with **Vagrant** on **Ubuntu**, providing an isolated development workspace.
   
2. **Source Control & CI/CD**:
   - Used **GitHub** as the code repository and **Jenkins** to automate:
     - Pulling code from GitHub.
     - Building, testing, and analyzing the application.

3. **Build & Code Quality**:
   - Managed dependencies with **Maven** and generated coverage reports using **JaCoCo**.
   - Integrated **SonarQube** for code analysis to identify bugs and code smells.

4. **Artifact Management**:
   - Stored build artifacts in **Nexus**, ensuring versioned storage for reliable access.

5. **Containerization**:
   - Built Docker images and pushed them to **Docker Hub**, ready for deployment.

6. **Security Scanning**:
   - Scanned Docker images for vulnerabilities using **Trivy**.

7. **Monitoring**:
   - Implemented **Grafana** and **Prometheus** for detailed application metrics monitoring.

8. **Notifications**:
   - Configured **email notifications** for Jenkins job statuses.

## üìã Pipeline Stages

Here's an overview of the CI/CD pipeline stages, automated with Jenkins:

1. **Code Pull**: Fetch code from GitHub.
2. **Build**: Compile the application with Maven.
3. **Test**: Run unit tests and generate code coverage reports.
4. **Code Analysis**: Analyze code quality with SonarQube.
5. **Artifact Deployment**: Push build artifacts to Nexus.
6. **Dockerization**: Build and push Docker images to Docker Hub.
7. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities with Trivy.
8. **Monitoring Setup**: Use Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and alerts.
